# ev3-Luigi
Lego Mindstorms EV3 Robot
Programming the Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot: 

The Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot is a very popular robot that is usually programmed using an icon-based programming system. You can also use ev3dev (www.ev3dev.org) which is a Debian Linux-based OS that runs on several compatible platforms including the Lego Mindstorms EV3 and Raspberry Pi-powered BrickPi. 

With a Linux inside, you can program how you want to program. The EV3 with a Linux computer inside can there be programmed using different programming languages such as Python, C++ or Java. With my 7 years old daughter as product owner and project manager, and myself as doer, we used Python to control sensors and motors of the robot. With some programming skills, it’s quite easy and fun to practice robotics, Internet of Thing and Artificial Intelligence using EV3.

1. The product owner asked to speak with the robot. His name is Luigi!

The chatbot has been developed using ChatterBot, a Python library using a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses and MongoDB to store statements and dialogues. You can find more information about this chatbot in Github: https://github.com/xaviervasques/TheBigBangTheory_Chat

2. Object Tracking and recognition … or rather “Mr. Strong” Tracking and Recognition

We installed a CMUcam5 Pixy camera (left Luigi’s hand). Pixy is a partnership between the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute and Charmed Labs. Pixy is a fully open source embedded camera that has a dual core ARM processor, USB/I2C/UART/SPI communication, and built-in computer vision algorithms. We programmed Luigi to only recognize “Mr Strong”. 

3. Luigi Dancing !

The product owner also requested Luigi to Dance. We developed some random movements that we can adapt depending on the song. 

4. Luigi is on a course.
